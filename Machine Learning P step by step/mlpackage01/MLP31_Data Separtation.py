# Machine learning Data separation into
# Training and test data for ML
# Algorithm Evaluation (Method :- 4)

# 1- Train and test set Split
# 2- K fold cross validation
# 3- Leave One out Cross Validation
# 4- Repeated Random Train Set Split
 # Training Data(67%) + Testing Data (33%) is called historic Data.
 # We save the data 33% of whole data for testing purpose.
